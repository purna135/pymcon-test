## PyMCon Web Series

The PyMCon Web Series is a series of events led by members of the PyMC community.  Events allow community members to share their cool tricks, best practices, general knowledge, and methods with the wider PyMC community.  A central feature of the PyMCon Web Series is that events can take on a variety of formats.  One community member may propose a hackathon focusing on Bayesian models in a particular application or using a particular data set.  Another might propose a poster to visualize a new Arviz functionality.  Traditional presentations are welcome too!  Contributors whose proposals are accepted will be teamed with a PyMCon Web Series lead who will provide guidance about how to transform the proposal into a full-blown PyMCon Web Series event.
